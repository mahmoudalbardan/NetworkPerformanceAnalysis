# Network Performance Prediction SystemðŸ“¡

This repository is designed to build a network performance prediction system based 
on data from the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/anomaly-detection-in-4g-cellular-networks/overview). 
A gradio application that allows interacting with the system is also built.

The dataset, organized row-wise, contains measurements from **33 LTE 4G cells**, with each cell characterized
by **11 OSS counters** related to **PRB usage**, **throughput**, and the **number of connected user equipment devices**.

In addition to OSS counters, each row includes:
- The **cell name**
- A **timestamp** (e.g., `"07:15"`)
- A **label** indicating whether the cellâ€™s activity at that time is **"usual"** or **"unusual"**

The data is recorded at **15-minute intervals**.
## Approach
We developed two types of models to build the prediction system:
1. Time series forecasting model:  
   Using **Prophet** to forecast OSS counters based on historical trends. In this step, each couple of **(cell, oss counter) has its own model**.
2. Classification model:  
   Predicting whether a given set of OSS counter values corresponds to **usual** or **unusual** activity.

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

- `src/` â€“ Source code for preprocessing, modeling, evaluation and building a Gradio application.
- `models/` â€“ Saved trained models (oss counters forecasting models and classifier performance degradation).
- `tests/` â€“ Unit tests for validation.
- `experimental/` â€“ **Experimental notebooks that you can consult to check the outcome of the data processing step and the forecastings**.
- `configuration.ini` â€“ Configuration file used during launch.
- `Dockerfile` â€“ Docker setup.
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Python dependencies.

## ðŸš€ Launch and test the app on your Local Machine

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmoudalbardan/NetworkPerformanceAnalysis.git
cd NetworkPerformanceAnalysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the training scripts (Optional since the models already trained and saved in the repository)
```bash
python src/network_activity_classification.py --configuration configuration.ini 
python src/oss_counters_forecasting.py --configuration configuration.ini 
```
The network activity classification model will be automatically saved at `models/network_activity_classifier.pkl`, 
while the OSS counter forecasting models will be stored individually under
`models/oss_counters_forecasting_models/`, following the name `prophet_{cell_name}_{oss_counter}.pkl`

5. Build docker image
```bash
docker build -t networkapp .
```
6.  Run docker container
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 networkapp
```
7. Open [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser and test the gradio app !
